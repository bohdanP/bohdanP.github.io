We just need to understand that, take it away from that street mentality. Let's take it to the corporate mentality."</p><p class="large">While that might lead us to believe that the senator supports full legalization, other comments made to the Tampa Bay Post contradict that impression: "During the session with reporters, Nelson also talked about the move to legalize marijuana in Florida. He said he opposes across the board legalization of the drug because he believes it is harmful. But 'marijuana used as a medical relief for people that are desperate, I agree that ought to be legal,' he said."</p>

In an interview with The Red &amp; Black, Senator Isakson made the following statement: "Not everybody who’s ever smoked marijuana is a drug addict, but every drug addict started on marijuana, so you’ve got to be very careful with any legalization. The cannabis oil, which is medicinal, is proven to help infants and small children who have abnormalities in terms of seizures. That’s something we ought to be investigating, but I don’t think that legalizing the growth of marijuana within the state allegedly for medical purposes is a good idea. You know what ends up happening in Colorado and Oregon, and I don’t think that would be good for Georgia."</p><p class="large">At this time, it does not appear that Sen.

His focus has been more on drugs like meth, and he has said little about cannabis directly. He has no related voting record, except for voting against harsher penalties for drug offenses, but a press release in 2015 shows that he believes in: “...limited government and a free and open economy. The government should not be caretakers.”</p><p class="large">Given his crusades against drugs in the past, there is little to believe he would support legalization of cannabis. He has had his own brushes with the law, arrested for a DUI in 2012, which sent shock throughout his constituency, as Sen. Crapo is a devout Mormon.</p>

While Sen. Grassley claims to believe that cannabis has viable medicinal use in some cases, he is refusing to support the legislation. Currently, he is blocking hearings on this revolutionary legislation, which is stalling the Act's progress. The Des Moines Register reports on the Senators comments regarding the legislation: "I oppose moving marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II drug, based on the current science on the risks and benefits....Recent studies suggest marijuana use by young people can cause long-term and possibly permanent damage to brain development...for children suffering from severe epileptic seizures, the anecdotal evidence says components of the marijuana plant might help. I want to help those children. The key is aggressive medical research."</p><p class="large">And how do you achieve aggressive research on cannabis, Senator? Reclassify marijuana so it's easier to study. Current efforts to sway Senator Grassley on the issue are involving his constituents and will hopefully prove fruitful.</p>

In June of 2015, MintPress News assessed McConnell's attitudes on the country's shifting views on marijuana legalization:</p><p class="large">"McConnell acknowledges that marijuana is 'not in the same category as heroin,' even if it is treated as such by the DEA. Still, he said that legalizing the plant could 'completely transform your society in a way that I think certainly most Kentuckians would not agree with....'I don’t think an answer to this, honestly, is to go in a direction of legalizing any of these currently illegal drugs,' McConnell explained. 'This whole movement in various parts of the country is a big mistake.'"</p><p class="large">Interestingly, McConnell has been as passionate about protecting hemp as he has been on prohibiting marijuana. Also in 2015, McConnell fought to allow hemp seeds to be brought into Kentucky for cultivation, with the hope of a new viable crop for industrial use. However, hemp is a different type of cannabis, containing very little THC, making McConnell's support less hypocritical than some might think.</p>

ThinkProgress commented on the evolution:</p><p class="large">"The progressive hero offered only a flat 'no' in response to a question about legalizing marijuana in 2011.

The Weed Blog notes that in 2011, the Senator remarked:</p><p class="large">“we’ve learned more. A couple of states have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Frankly, I think we ought to be learning what we can from those states.”</p><p class="large">While these may not be revolutionary words, they're a big step up from her views in 2011, views that are hopefully still evolving.</p>

This amendment would have prevented the federal government from arresting AIDS, MS, and cancer patients who use marijuana for medical reasons in states that have medical marijuana laws. Unfortunately, this provision failed 165-262. I voted for the amendment because, while I have not yet seen conclusive evidence indicating that marijuana is safe or effective for use in treating medical ailments, I don't believe that patients with severe, chronic diseases should be arrested and federally prosecuted for medical use of marijuana where such use has been approved by the state government in which they reside."</p><p class="large">More recently, he and several other senators have urged federal agencies to move forward with research on marijuana, which shows he's at least interested in learning more about the benefits of cannabis.</p>

Senator Heller has not only shown interest in legislation supporting medical, he's sponsored it. Heller is one of the co-sponsors of the sweeping CARERS Act, which would re-schedule cannabis to a Schedule II drug and allow states to set their own regulations and policies on medical cannabis, including for veteran patients. In a press release from around the time the bill was introduced in 2015, Heller stated:</p><p class="large">“The time has come for the federal government to stop impeding the doctor-patient relationship in states that have decided their own medical marijuana policies. This bipartisan legislation puts Americans who are suffering first by allowing Nevada’s medical marijuana patients, providers, and businesses that are in compliance with state law, to no longer be in violation of federal law and vulnerable to federal prosecution."</p><p class="large">Though in favor of medical marijuana, Heller has not specifically addressed recreational cannabis yet, an issue many lawmakers have still not had to discuss much up to this point.</p>

She stated:</p><p class="large">"Well, I do support our medical marijuana law. And we're seeing some states who have allowed marijuana for recreational purposes. I'm not ready to go there yet.

				<p class="large">Booker was one of the first Senators to co-sponsor the CARERS Act in 2015, a bold move that placed him firmly within the opinions of most Americans. Sponsoring overdue legislation to federally legalize medical marijuana when so many states have already adopted programs was a smart move for Booker. While the legislation has been stalled, Booker has nonetheless shown he is in tune with his constituents' wishes.</p><p class="large">Booker may not have endorsed recreational use directly, but he made statements in 2012 to the Huffington Post on live video that addressed his disdain for the "war on drugs" and showed an interest in reforming marijuana and sentencing laws as a whole, something he has been working on with Sen. Rand Paul. In an interview with Inc.com in 2014, he stated that he's waiting to see how legalization works out in Washington, Colorado, and others before making a decision about his position on the issue:</p><p class="large">"This is a really valuable American laboratory. The legalization debate, on which I don't know where I come down on yet, [will allow us to see how] certain legitimate concerns manifest themselves. Where I take it now is to do things to protect people who are abiding by state laws. For me, that's why I introduced the legislation around medical marijuana with Rand Paul--we don't want to see the federal government prosecuting people abiding state laws. I am encouraged voters stepped out into this laboratory. If it's a failure, it's a failure. But if it's a success and it doesn't hurt public safety and improves the economy by providing greater opportunities, and doesn't cause more crime, then I will be open to legalization. But right now I fall on not doing it, but I am one of those people who is hungry to watch it play out. Medical marijuana programs, like the one in New Jersey, are something I think should be in every state; the drugs people have in their medicine cabinets are more dangerous than marijuana. It's ridiculous to not let very sick people have access to a drug, a legitimate drug, that can help improve their lives."</p>

She's also urged the VA to allow veterans to discuss cannabis as a treatment option in states where it is legal. In a keynote speech at the National Cannabis Industry Association in late 2015, Gillebrand laid out the problems with the current legislation: No one is sure what to do about the disconnect between state and federal laws. In her own words:</p><p class="large">"There's a conflict between state and federal statute that confuses doctors, patients and providers alike. People aren't sure what's legal, what's not, and the gray area that resulted is hindering health care and the industry's development....There’s a grave lack of any marijuana research. This is a direct result of federal requirements that only govern the study of marijuana. No other drug, Schedule I or otherwise, has been subjected to the same constraints.”</p><p class="large">Looks like Sen. Gillibrand's out to change that.

He took a quick poll of the audience asking how many supported the free sell of marijuana; how many supported legalizing it for medical use; and how many opposed any legalization of marijuana.</p><p class="large">A few people raised their hands for open sales of marijuana. Roughly 35 percent of the audience raised their hands for medical marijuana use. Tillis said he presumed the remainder were opposed to marijuana use of any form.</p><p class="large">
        Tillis said he doesn’t understand why opiates can be legally used with a prescription but not marijuana. He said he thinks lawmakers should be able to strike a balance in the debate but more study will have to be done 'to find out if there is an appetite for it in North Carolina.'"</p><p class="large">

No, I don’t think it’s time to make marijuana usable for medical purposes, but I do think the chemistry within it should be refined and the active ingredients should be made available where the Food and Drug Administration says that they can appropriately regulate it and distribute it. So the part that is good for some of these kids, I think it should be made available for them in its refined form, not as a joint.”</p><p class="large">Senator Rounds does not seem like he has too much interest in the issue, so he will probably not be pushing for more cannabis research anytime soon.</p>

				<p class="large">In a classic Republican stance, Lamar Alexander is taking the view that states should be allowed to make their own laws surrounding marijuana legalization. A spokesperson for the Senator replied to the Times Free Press's inquiries in 2014 that:</p><p class="large">
        "Sen. Alexander believes that Washington, D.C. should not be telling states what to do about the decriminalization of marijuana... [Senator Alexander's] own views, while there may be some valid medicinal uses for cannabis, he is concerned about the potential abuse and widespread use of drugs for recreational purposes and is carefully watching the de-criminalization process in the states of Colorado and Washington."</p><p class="large">Taking a "sit back and wait" approach is much better than outright dismissal, so perhaps in the future, Sen. Alexander will evolve his views further to be more in line with the shifting views of many Americans.</p>

				<p class="large">Neither of Wyoming's Senators are supportive of even medical marijuana, despite two related bills being approved by the state's legislature. Sen. Enzi uses the "gateway drug" theory to explain his stance. A spokesman for Enzi stated in 2015:</p><p class="large">“There is strong evidence that marijuana does act as a gateway drug, and Sen. Enzi believes we must think about what kind of message these laws would send to our young people. There is also no clear science-based evidence that medical marijuana is more effective than other regulated medicines. Approval of medical marijuana use at this time is premature until the research is more conclusive about benefits and risk.”</p><p class="large">If Enzi and other Senators  vote down descheduling marijuana in the future, that research isn't going to be possible anytime soon.</p>
